At ETA Fabrik, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Benedikt, a PhD student who was working on a project that aimed to optimize industrial machines' energy consumption, but also a great mentor and an excellent software engineer.

I was working on the [eta-utility library](https://git.ptw.maschinenbau.tu-darmstadt.de/eta-fabrik/public/eta-utility), which was the main library responsible for connecting to the machines, but had many other functions, such as APIs for tracking energy cost, many types of connectors to different machines, etc.

At the beginning of this MiniJob (~10 hours per week), I was responsible for solving every issue it was opened, which was a tough and boring task, but gave me a lot of room to understand the library and improve my Python skills.

With some confidence in my work, more and more projects were arriving, such as designing an API for the energy prices, designing Docker images for integration testing using CI/CD, and finally the work that I am most proud of: integrating Julia and Python to execute a genetic algorithm (NSGA2) faster, therefore all the execution should be made in Julia.
