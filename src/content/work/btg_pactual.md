I rank the experience at BTG Pactual as one of the most exciting along my student journey. Mainly, as a summer intern, they make sure that your three months are really worth it. As I was working 40h+ per week, I could connect with my colleagues and managed to make some really great, long-lasting friends.

As the Data Analytics team, they are required to handle most of the data-related problems inside the bank. The team was relatively new, perhaps born in 2017. Because of that, I've been exposed to the latest data technologies, which back then was: PySpark for handling Big Data, AWS services for handling mostly everything, Apache AirFlow, and many others. This was impressive, for a young data enthusiast.

I worked on the front side of the team, directly talking to internal clients and working together to help with their problems. By the end of the second week, I was already able to deliver an interesting project. The marketing team wanted to know the best locations for a marketing campaign, and by using open-source data we were able to generate some interesting solutions, that led to effective revenue growth.
