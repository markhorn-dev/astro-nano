As a Senior Staff Software Engineer, I am a technical leader with expertise across the full software development stack. I work on a variety of projects that span across the mobile, web and api domains, collaborating with different internal and partner teams to deliver complex solutions. My past experiences and in-depth knowledge allows me to make high-level technical decisions and also mentor up and coming junior/senior individual contributors.
